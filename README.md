# Feedback App backend

Frontend for my version of the [Frontend Mentor Product feedback app](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-feedback-app-wbvUYqjR6) challenge.

[Live demo](https://rf-feedback-app.netlify.app/)  
[Backend repo](https://github.com/riccardofano/feedback-app-backend)

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.  
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
